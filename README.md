Pi-Control
==========
This file is incomplete
This project is one which I have been working on for a while. The program will be put on my raspberry pi and will be used to give commands and ask questions. Some of this code is very messy and it has very few comments. I will go back later to do some cleanup and to hopefully add comments.
